# SlidingMirror


For use in combining two beams in a microscopy setup. A mirror is moved into position with high reposition accuracy. It has been tested on lasers with  path lengths >3m and found to allow better repeatability than for example a ThorLabs flip mirror. It also has the advangtage of optionally being automated.
A translation stage is used to provide the linear translation whilst movement is generated by a servo. A spring coules the servo arm to the stage, allowing the stage to be held tight against one end of its range

Could also be used to add/remove other components e.g. lenses, from optical path where high positional accuracy is needed.

The design comes in two sizes, based around the 13mm and 25mm translation stages available from ThorLabs. 25mm is easier to set-up and allows space for multiple optical components on the stage, whilst 13mm has a smaller footprint. If using the 13mm, then the 'edgeless' mirror design may be useful.

Assumes mounting on an optical breadboard with 25mm spacing for M6 bolts
